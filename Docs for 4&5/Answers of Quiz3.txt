4. What is the difference between code-first approach and database approach in Entity
framework
Answer:
In code first approach we will first create entity classes with properties defined in it. Entity framework will create the database and tables based on the entity classes defined. So database is generated from the code. When the dot net code is run database will get created.


What is the MVVM design pattern?

Answer
Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) is a structural design pattern that separates objects into three distinct groups:
1.Models hold application data. They’re usually structs or simple classes.
2.Views display visual elements and controls on the screen. They’re typically subclasses of UIView.
3.View models transform model information into values that can be displayed on a view. They’re usually classes, so they can be passed around as references.
